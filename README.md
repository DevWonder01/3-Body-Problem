# Three-Body Simulation and Lyapunov Exponent Calculation

## Overview
This project simulates the motion of three bodies under gravitational attraction and calculates the proximity function to analyze the system's chaotic behavior. It uses Python libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `pygame`, and `tqdm` for numerical calculations, data handling, visualization, animation, and progress tracking.

## Project Structure
- `Body` class: Represents a single body in the system.
- `System` class: Represents the entire three-body system.
- Various functions for simulation, visualization, and Lyapunov exponent calculation.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `pygame`
- `tqdm`

You can install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib pygame tqdm
```
