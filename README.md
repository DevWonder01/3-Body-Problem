# Three-Body Simulation and Lyapunov Exponent Calculation

## Overview
This project simulates the motion of three bodies under gravitational attraction and calculates the proximity function to analyze the system's chaotic behavior. It combines the language of Python and C++ to create fast calculations and visualizations of the periodic trajectories that are possible.
